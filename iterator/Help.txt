(directory.php)
Internally all iterator implement the Iterator Interface, most of the time calling a foreach loop calls them
automatically

Method      |       Description
------------------------------------
rewind()    |   Moves iterator back to the first element
key()       |   Returns the key of the current element which can be a number or a string
current()   |   Returns the value of the current element
next()      |   Moves to the next element
valid()     |   Checks whether there is another element to move to

(fileSystem.php)
Single Directory iterator


DirectoryIterator                       |                  FilesystemIterator
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Includes Dot files.                    | 1)Dot files are skipped, but .htaccess are treated normally.
2)Works like an indexed array using.     | 2)Path name uses key for each element.
  numbers to identify each element.      |
3)Path not included in value.            | 3)Path included in the value.
4)No configuration options.              | 4)Options can be set by using class constants.
5)Array requires cloned objects.         | 5)Cloning not necessary for the current object to assign it to an array.

(recursive_directory.php)
1) To enter sub directories we need to use the RecursiveDirectoryIterator.
2) We need to use constants from the parent class, that would be FilesystemIterator.
3) When using a recursive iterator, we need to chain it to RecursiveIteratorIterator (its an iterator for an iterator, I know funny!)
4) Pass the argument as the current iterator i.e. RecursiveDirectoryIterator instance we are using to RecursiveIteratorIterator.
5) The common directories have only one level of sub directory but recursive directory iterator can handle multiple levels.
6) By default recursive RecursiveIteratorIterator accesses only child elements, so directory names are omitted.
7) To display the directory names we need to pass a second argument to the RecursiveIteratorIterator constructor.
   Code:- $dir = new RecursiveIteratorIterator($dir,RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST);

   To reverse the effect,
   Code:- new RecursiveIteratorIterator($dir,RecursiveIteratorIterator::CHILD_FIRST);
8) RecursiveIteratorIterator will keep going recursively no matter how many levels the file structure has, to limit the
   number of levels, we can use the set setMaxDepth();
   Code:- $dir->setMaxDepth(0);

(fileInfo.php)
1) It displays the relative path of every file in the directory.
2) This value is being displayed by the toString Method of the object that represents the current element in the foreach loop.
3) We can filter the given result by getting  getExtension() method
4) We can get the absolute path of the file using the getRealPath() method.

File and Directory Permissions
------------------------------
* isDir()           =>  Determines if the file is a directory
* isFile()          =>  Checks if the file exists and is a regular file
* isReadable()      =>  Checks if the file is readable
* isWritable()      =>  Checks if the file is writable
* isExecutable()    =>  Checks if the file is executable


Filename and path
-----------------
* getFilename()     =>  Gets the filename only
* getPath()         =>  Gets the relative path without trailing slash or filename
* getPathname()     =>  Gets the relative path including filename
* getRealPath()     =>  Gets the absolute path
* getPathInfo()     =>  Gets an SplFileInfo object for the file's parent


File Statistics and Type
------------------------
* getSize()         =>  Gets the file size in bytes
* getATime()        =>  Gets timestamp for when file last accessed
* getMTime()        =>  Gets timestamp for when contents modified
* getExtension()    =>  Gets the filename extension (PHP 5.3.6+)
* getType()         =>  Returns file, link or dir


Access File Contents
--------------------
* OpenFile()        =>  Creates an SplFileObject
